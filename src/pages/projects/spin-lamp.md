Alia, Latin for “Change”, is a candle holder that does exactly that. Made from a single repeating branch, Alia is all about creating free compositions. One branch works alone, but stacking more is just so much more impressive.

<br>

Sold in units of 1 or 3.

<br>
<br>

Alia is available for purchase at our [retailers](https://google.com), and in our [shop](https://google.com).
