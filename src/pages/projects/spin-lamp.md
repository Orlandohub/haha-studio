A chubby, satin orbit of spin-pressed aluminum nearly consumes the socket and bulb. For its compact size, the Spin Lamp emits a diffuse light creating ambience without the need for a cumbersome shade.

<br/>

Install as pendant or wall. For home, retail, public, and hospitality spaces.

<br/>


Spin Lamp will be available from August 2019, email us if you are interested in pre-ordering the lamp.
