Alia, Latin for “Change” , is a candle holder that does exactly that. Made from a single repeating branch, Alia is all about creating free compositions. One branch works alone, but stacking more is just so much more impressive. 

<br>

Sold in units of 1 or 3.

Alia is available for purchase at our [retailers](/retailers/).
