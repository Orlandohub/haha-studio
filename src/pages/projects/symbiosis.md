Our friends, Lambert & Fils, asked us to design an exhibition for their Mile light collection.

<br/>

Playing with the notion that a work of design never exists by itself, HAHA explored the symbiosis of light and nature. The Mile lighting was intertwined with lush plants. Itâ€™s innate to all of us that coexistence makes a habitat. Nothing exists alone. The exhibition presents the universally palpable idea that just a few thoughtfully composed things can distinctly enhance a space.
