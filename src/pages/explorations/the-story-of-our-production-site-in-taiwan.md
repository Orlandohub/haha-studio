As we have mentioned in our previous story, we are enthusiasts of working side by side with craftspeople. Their knowledge and experience are priceless. One of our frequent collaborators is Sven-Eric Söderström from Enköping, Sweden.

Svenne (as we call him) has been working in the steel production business for his whole life (he is now 67). He pretty much masters everything from cutting, welding, bending – even in his sleep. While smoking on his cigars and drinking pitch black coffee, he has been a remarkable advisor and loyal friend of HAHA.
