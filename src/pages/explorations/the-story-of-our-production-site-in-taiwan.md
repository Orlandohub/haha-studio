HAHA studio is a Stockholm-based design practice founded by Swedish designer Arash Eskafi and Taiwanese designer Yujin Chiang that operates across different areas within the design field. Since its’ beginning in 2015, the duo has created unique lighting fixtures, interior accessories, one-off design pieces and has regularly collaborated with local and international clients on interior architecture projects and spatial installations. By creating objects that “have a story to tell and a statement to make,” the studio’s work combines influences from both Scandinavian and Asian cultures with a commitment to details and quality as well as an interest in cultural forms, heritage, and contextual expression. The multicultural backgrounds of the designers have continuously forced them to reflect upon preconceptions in design and have given them a ground from where to develop a novel and contemporary design practice.
