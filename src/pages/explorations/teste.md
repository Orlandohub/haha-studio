Back in the summer of 2015 – when our practice was still nameless – our first collaborative trip to Taiwan took place. One could refer to that as the starting point of HAHA. Our ambition was (and still is) to work closely with artisans and craftspeople on the island. To discuss, understand, learn, and laugh together. 

With strong ambitions and drive, we visited numerous workshops with an old scooter as our vehicle in the scorching summer. After countless visiting, we managed to establish our network of amazing craftspeople.
