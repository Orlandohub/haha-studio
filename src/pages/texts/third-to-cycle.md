Proposing playful products and experience is important for a designer. However, when starting HAHA, this was not quite the first message we wanted to share, or maybe not the only one. In fact, we are quite skeptical about the notion of “playfulness” as it is today widely used by cynical marketing agents, gaming groups or uninspired creators as a catch-all and empty motto.
