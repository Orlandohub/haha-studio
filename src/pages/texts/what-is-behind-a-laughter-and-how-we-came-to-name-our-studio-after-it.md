title: What is behind a laughter and how we came to name our studio after it
---
Proposing playful products and experience is important for a designer. However, when starting HAHA, this was not quite the first message we wanted to share, or maybe not the only one. In fact, we are quite skeptical about the notion of “playfulness” as it is today widely used by cynical marketing agents, gaming groups or uninspired creators as a catch-all and empty motto. If we need to recognize the essence of our human character as Homo Ludens, we believe that’s it is not in the 4 corners of our computer screen, neither in the false user-friendly formulas, or the illusionary work/play society models that are offered to us today. For us, HAHA is first an interjection, an intuitive reaction to something that might be funny, uncomfortable or embarrassing. It is also a social response, a sign of participation and presence. And that is how we like to interpret our name; laughing is instinctive, it is a vocal expression that can be understood by all of us regardless of the language we talk. We see the role of design similarly. Naive - in the form only - the design we want to make promote emotions and intuitive expression. Inclusive - but not for the mass - our design search to cross boundaries without losing quality. As designers, we focus on form and emotion, but also on qualitative materials, techniques, and concepts.
