title: What is behind laughter?
---
HAHA is at first an interjection, a reaction to something funny, uncomfortable or maybe embarrassing. It’s a sign of participation. It means “I am present right here, right now.” This is studio HAHA’s method. To be present in the moment, to participate, to work from instinct. With a naive approach, HAHA shapes materials into objects that are both easy to understand and emotive.The studio’s work may not be a laughing matter, but it certainly strikes a tone.
